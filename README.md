# World Happiness Index Analysis

This repository explores the World Happiness Report over 2015-2019 across the countries of the world with measures of the world happiness index and mertrics of socioeconomic factors. This project contains insights on the impact of several factors on happiness using data visualizations. 

## Overview

This project focuses on two research questions:
 1. Does time have an effect on the happiness rate? (i.e. do the “happiest” countries tend to stayhappy even after a certain number of years and do the “saddest” countries tend to stay sad even after a certain number of years?). And does the region of the country play a role in this?
 
 2. How does the birth rate in the data set correlate with its reported happiness levels? Are thereany underlying socioeconomic factors that might explain the relationship?

Our analysis of these questions highlights the correlation with birth rate and happiness, as well as identifies if the happiest countries and the unhappiest countries stay consistent over a period of time and if the region plays a role in this consistency.  

### Interesting Insight

Given that our project centers around the Happiness Scores of over a hundred countries, our most interesting insight comes from our visualization showing if happiness changed over the course of five years for the top and bottom five countries.

This gives us key information about whether a countries' happiness score stays consistent or not throughout the years. For any increases or decreases, we can look deeper into the countries and look for any outside factors that contributed to this change.

## Repo Structure

### Data
- 2015.csv, 2016.csv, 2017.csv, 2018.csv, 2019.csv
   1. Each file contains each countries Happiness Index for that year. 
- world_bank_development_indicators.csv
   1. This file is our secondary dataset which was used to provide       
       additional support to our initial goal of analyzing the global factors 
       that can impact the happiness scores of regions

### Project
