# World Happiness Index Analysis

This repository explores the World Happiness Report over 2015-2019 across the countries of the world with measures of the world happiness index and mertrics of socioeconomic factors. This project contains insights on the impact of several factors on happiness using data visualizations. 

## Overview

This project focuses on two research questions:
 
 1: Does time have an effect on happiness rate?

 2: How does the birth rate in the data set correlate with it's reported happiness        levels?

Our analysis of these questions highlights the correlation with birth rate and happiness, as well as identify if the happiest countries and the unhappiest countries stay consistent over a period of time. 

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.


## Repo Structure

### Data
