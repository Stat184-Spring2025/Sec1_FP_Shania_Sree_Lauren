# World Happiness Index Analysis

This repository explores the World Happiness Report over 2015 to 2019 across the countries surveyed. In the World Happiness Report, we analyze the happiness score and region of each country. In the World Bank Development Indicators data set, we analyze the correlation between socioeconomic factors and the happiness score for each country.

## Overview

This project focuses on two research questions:

 1. Does time have an effect on the happiness rate? (i.e. do the “happiest” countries tend to stay happy even after a certain number of years and do the “saddest” countries tend to stay sad even after a certain number of years?). And does the region of the country play a role in this?
   
 3. How does the birth rate in the data set correlate with its reported happiness levels? Are there any underlying socioeconomic factors that might explain the relationship?

Our analysis indicates that countries' happiness score tends to stay consistent over time, region correlates with happiness score, and birth rate correlates with happiness score.

### Interesting Insight

Our most interesting insight shows that happiness stays consistent over time for the top five happiest countries.  For the five least happy countries, their happiness score can increase over time.

Moreover, this visualization invites further conversation of possible outside factors that contributed to observed changes. 

## Repo Structure

### Data

- 2015.csv, 2016.csv, 2017.csv, 2018.csv, 2019.csv

   1. Each file contains the Happiness Index of the set of countries surveyed for that year. 

- world_bank_development_indicators.csv

   1. We used this file as our secondary data set. The data set added socioeconomic factors that could have impacted the happiness scores of each county.

### Project

- final_project.qmd

  1. This QMD file displayed our code, visualizations, and narrative text.
