# World Happiness Index Analysis

This repository explores the World Happiness Report over 2015-2019 across the countries of the world with measures of the world happiness index and mertrics of socioeconomic factors. This project contains insights on the impact of several factors on happiness using data visualizations. 

## Overview

This project focuses on two research questions:
 
 1: Does time have an effect on happiness rate?

 2: How does the birth rate in the data set correlate with it's reported happiness levels?

Our analysis of these questions highlights the correlation with birth rate and happiness, as well as identify if the happiest countries and the unhappiest countries stay consistent over a period of time. 

### Interesting Insight

Given that our project centers around the Happiness Scores of over 100 countries, our most interesting insight comes from our visualization showing if happiness changed over the course of five years for the top and bottom 5 countries.

This gives us key information about whether a countries' happiness score stays consistent or not throughout the years. For any increases or decreases, we can look deeper into the countries and look for any outside factors that contributed to this change.

## Repo Structure
